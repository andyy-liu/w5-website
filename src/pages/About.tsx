              W5 was founded in 2016 by Braden Ream, Zach Friedman and Kirill Kokokrev, with the goal 
              of giving idea-stage student entrepreneurs the mentorship, accountability, and resources 
              they couldn't find elsewhere on campus. What began as a three-person pilot project is 
              now Western's fastest growing organization with over 2000 student entrepreneurs, alumni, and 
              mentors.
